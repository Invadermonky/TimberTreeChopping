# Changelog 1.12.2-1.2.0

### Fixes
- Improved axe tool check to be more robust
- (Fix [#2](https://github.com/Invadermonky/TimberTreeChopping/issues/2#issue-1333920292)) Removed the `destroyLeaves`
  setting from the config (it was broken and didn't really work)
- (Fix [#3](https://github.com/Invadermonky/TimberTreeChopping/issues/3#issue-1766372843)) Axes now have the correct
  damage applied when breaking trees. There may be some inconsistencies with the Unbreaking enchant at lower durability, 
  but I cant fix these without a complete rewrite of a large chunk of the mod.

### Some Quick Notes
- This mod is not abandoned. I really don't have an excuse for my absence, but I'm now working on this and other projects.
- This update will likely be the last before the next update which will completely overhaul this mod. This includes
  improved config handling, massively improved performance, better tool/log/leaf checks, and a completely new, immersive
  chopping method.
- There is no ETA on the "Timber 2.0" update as I have two other projects that currently have higher priority.
